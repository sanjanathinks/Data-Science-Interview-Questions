# Check whether two arrays are equal
Given two arrays, write a function in vanilla Python (e.g., no libraries) 
to check whether or not the arrays are equal. You can consider the two arrays equal 
if both of them contain the same set of elements - the order of elements can differ.

For example,
````python
#Given the following:
arr1 = [1,5,6,7,8,0]
arr2 = [0,5,7,6,8,1]

#output = Yes
arr3 = [1,5,6,7,8,0]
arr4 = [0,7,7,7,8,1]
````
